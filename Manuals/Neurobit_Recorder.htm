<p><b>Neurobit Recorder</b> (record.exe) is a simple, yet creating many possibilities 
application, which 
enables to record physiological signals collected wirelessly with equipment by Neurobit 
Systems. Data can be stored on a computer disk in European Data Format (EDF) or text files. 
They can be imported by many signal analysis or spreadsheet applications, such as 
<a href="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/">EEGLAB</a> for Matlab, 
<a href="http://www.edfplus.info/downloads/downloads.html">Polyman</a> or Excel 
(including some freeware). For some devices, such as Neurobit Optima, the Neurobit 
Recorder can also test electrode-skin impedances & input circuit continuity.<br>
The application is running under Microsoft Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000 systems.

<h2><a name="prereq">1. Prerequisites</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><u>Neurobit Optima</u> devices:<br>
    Bluetooth communication port (built-in into a computer or as a USB adapter)
    compatible with the protocol version 1.1 or newer is required. To install Bluetooth 
    adapter follow an instruction delivered in its package.<br>
    Neurobit Optima device should be set in wireless communication range (usually 
    less than 10m). Before use a Bluetooth device should be paired with your computer. 
    Pairing code for Neurobit Optima is 0000. You can learn more about Bluetooth pairing 
    in Windows help.</p>
  <li><p><u>Neurobit Lite</u> devices:<br>
    Infrared (IR) communication port (built-in into a computer or in form of a USB adapter) 
    compatible with IrDA standard v. 1.0 or newer is required. To install IrDA adapter
    follow an instruction delivered in its package.<br>
    The Neurobit Lite device should be set with IR port oriented towards IR port 
    of your computer, no more than 0.5m from it, without physical obstructions 
    between both entities, preferably on the same axis. There should be no other 
    active IrDA devices (like cell phones) nearby.</p> 
    <p>HINT: If you used older BioEra software requiring IrComm2k driver 
      (i.e. not using Neurobit Driver 3.0 or later version), set the driver in 
      "Standard" mode or uninstall it completely.
    </p>
</ul>
 
<h2><a name="install">2. Installation</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run installer Neurobit_RecorderX_X.exe. It will unzip the application files 
    to selected folder ("C:\Program Files\Neurobit\Recorder" is the default).
  <li>Read license.txt file from the application folder.
  <li>Create a shortcut to main application file record.exe from the application 
    folder on your desktop and/or Menu Start.
</ol>
<p>(In order to uninstall the application the uninstall.bat program from the 
  application folder can be used.)</p>

<h2><a name="window">3. Main window</a></h2>
<p>The main application window is divided into several tabs, which can be selected
in the bar below main menu or with Next button in lower right corner of the window.
Apart from the common Session tab there are tabs of options depending on a selected 
device. These are a General tab with general device options and several tabs with 
settings for individual measurement channels. There may also appear additional tabs 
for some devices, e.g. Test tab. The Record tab enables to run measurements with 
configuration set on previous tabs.</p>
<p><u>As an example, settings for Neurobit Optima 2 device are described below.</u>
(Use of Neurobit Driver 3.0 is also assumed.) Please consult instruction manual of 
your device model and version to learn about available settings.</p>

<h3><a name="session">Session tab</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Session info</b><br>
    You can enter here a short session description 
    (up to 80 characters for EDF format), which will be saved in recording file.
    (This setting is optional.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Client info</b><br>
    You can enter here a short information about 
    examined person. The information (up to 80 characters for EDF format) will 
    be saved in recording file. (This setting is optional.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Time limit</b><br>
    Recording duration can be given here in hh:mm:ss format (hours and minutes can be omitted). 
    After the specified period of time the recording will be automatically stopped. 
    (If necessary, it is still possible to shorten a recording session, stopping it 
    manually; it is also possible to change time limit during the session.)
    <br>If this field is empty (or set to 0), the recording time is not automatically 
    limited (measurement should be stopped manually).</p>
  <li><p><b>Device name</b><br>
    One of measurement devices supported by the application is selected here.</p>
  <li><p><b>Output format</b> - selects format of the recording file.<br>
    EDF is a default.
    It is one of often used de facto standards for physiological signals.
    <p>The alternative text format (Tab Separated Values) needs many times more space,
    than binary EDF; also generated text files are not compatible with typical physiological 
    signal analysis software. Thus this format should be used only when brief recording
    of data for spreadsheet or similar general purpose applications is required.)
    <p>Many other formats for bio-signal files are in use, e.g. BDF, GDF, EEG, CNT, AVG. 
    If you need a file in another format, you can use one of free EDF converters 
    available in the web.</p>
  <li><p><b>Output file</b> - name of the recording file (including its folder 
    path, if current folder is not used).<br>
    In order to browse folders on your computer, you can click <b>Browse folders</b> 
    button below the file field. The path and file name selected in the browse window 
    will be copied to "Output file" field.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="general">General tab</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Link type</b> - type of link used for communication with the device.</p>

  <li><p><b>Device address</b> - Bluetooth address of Neurobit device (or name of 
    its communication module).<br> 
    If you have only one turned on Neurobit Optima device 
    in the wireless communication range, you can usually leave the default value in 
    this field. (Otherwise it is recommended to set here a specific address of a given device.
    Addresses of Bluetooth devices seen by your computer can be listed in system 
    "Control Panel"/"Bluetooth Devices".)</p>

  <li><p><b>Power mains frequency</b> [Hz] - sets mains frequency used in your 
    country, required for power interference filtering in the device.<br> 
    For example, most European countries uses 50 Hz mains, while 60 Hz is used in North America. 
    In most cases you can leave the default setting.</p>

    <p>NOTES: When Neurobit Driver is launched the first time on a given computer, it determines 
    mains frequency automatically, based on user's country given in locale info of the system. 
    The setting is then stored in the system registry. It is common for all applications 
    using Neurobit Driver and all users of a given computer. 
    Unlike other device settings, the mains frequency is not read from design or configuration files.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, manual frequency selection may be sometimes necessary, for example: 
    <ul>
      <li>when traveling and locale info is not up-to-date, or 
      <li>in Japan, where two power frequencies are in use.
    </ul>
    You can check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_power_around_the_world#Table_of_mains_voltages_and_frequencies" target="_blank">local power frequency</a> in the web.</p>

  <li><p><b>Silent mode</b> - turns off sound signalization of events (artifacts etc.) in the 
    device during measurements.<br>
    Visual signalization is not influenced. 
    (The option is insignificant in devices without sound transducer.)</p>

  <li><p><b>Device services</b> button - opens the application of device service functions, 
    for example firmware upgrade.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="chans">Chan A tab</a></h3>
<p>Neurobit Optima devices have versatile measurement channels, which functions can be
  defined by a user. It should be taken into consideration, that appearance and available 
  settings of some parameters (e.g. "Measurement range") may depend on other parameters
  (e.g. "Channel function"). When you change such superior parameter, all dependent 
  parameters are set to defaults.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Channel enable</b> - enables or disables the measurement channel.</p>
  <li><p><b>Channel label</b><br>
    You can enter here your short label for the 
    channel (e.g. "EEG FpzCz"), which will be stored in the recording file. 
    (The label is optional. For EDF files it is limited to 16 characters.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Sensor info</b><br>
    You can enter here your short description of 
    used transducer (e.g. "AgAgCl electrode"), which will be stored in the 
    recording file. (This description is optional. For EDF files it is limited to 80 characters.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Channel profile</b><br>
    The profile enables to set in one step the default parameters 
    for some basic types of physiological signals (fields of those 
    parameters are locked then). 
    <p>In order to freely set all parameters by yourself 
    select "User defined" option. It unlocks rest of the parameters without their 
    change. (Thus if you would like to use default settings of most parameters for 
    a specific profile (e.g. EEG) and set only one or two parameters on your own,
    you can first select that specific profile, next select "User defined" profile
    and do required minor changes.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Channel function</b><br>
    It enables to select measurement of voltage (default) or other physical quantity.</p>
  <li><p><b>Frequency characteristic</b><br>
    For voltage signals this option enables 
    to minimize signal delay or maximize frequency bandwidth. E.g. for 
    "Linear phase sharp" option the frequency bandwidth (in Hz) is 40% of sample rate, 
    and signal delay of analog-to-digital conversion is 19 samples. 
    For "Linear phase mild" characteristic the bandwidth is 30% of sample rate, 
    with 11 samples delay.</p>
    <p>This parameter is replaced with <b>Thermistor characteristic</b> for channel 
    function set to Temperature.</p>
  <li><p><b>Measurement range</b> - selects upper limit of signal values, which 
    can by measured.<br>
    Higher range protects against clipping of high amplitude signals,
    while lower range makes measurement more sensitive, thus reduces quantization noise
    of analog-to-digital conversion.
    <p>(Note for "Channel function" set to conductance measurement: the unit 1uS (micro Siemens) 
    equals 1micromhO used in electrophysiology.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Range minimum</b> - lower limit of measured signals (read only value 
    depending on "Measurement range" setting).</p>
  <li><p><b>Sample rate</b> - selects number of output signal samples per second.<br>
    Higher sample rate enables to measure faster signals, whereas lower sample rate
    reduces high frequency noise and size of recorded files.</p>
  <li><p><b>Power interference filter</b> - turns on or off device's filter of power 
    mains interferences.<br>
    (Filter notch frequency is set by "Power mains frequency"
    option on General tab.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Sum disconnected</b><br>
    The option disconnecting sum voltage in channel 
    from common voltage feedback amplifier (generating virtual ground potential). 
    This option have to be cleared for channels galvanically connected with body 
    (measuring EEG, EMG, GSR etc. signals on the skin surface). It is recommended 
    to set the option for channels connected to transducers with asymmetric 
    (two-wire) voltage output.</p>
  <li><p><b>Common reference</b><br>
    This option informs of external connection of "-" input of a given channel to 
    a common reference electrode. Its suitable selection is required for correct results 
    of electrode-skin impedance tests for such inputs. Up to two independent common 
    references are supported.</p>
    <p>(This setting does not cause any internal connections of inputs in the device. 
    It also has no influence on regular measurements - apart from tests of electrode-skin 
    impedances. It does not apply to channel functions different than "Voltage".)</p>
</ul>

<h3>Chan B tab</h3>
<p>Parameters for channel B are set similarly as for channel B.</p>

<h3><a name="test">Test tab</a></h3>
<p>This tab enables to test input circuit connections and electrode-skin impedances for enabled channels
before actual signal recordings. Although optional, execution of the test is recommended.
<ul>
  <li><p>State indicators (<b>Link</b>, <b>Battery</b>, <b>Pause</b>, 
    <b>Common voltage</b>, <b>Channel A</b>, <b>Channel B</b>)<br>
    See similar indicators on <a href="#record">Record tab</a>.</p>
  <li><p>Impedance indicators<br>
    For channels with voltage measurement setting there are
    two sets of indicators of electrode-skin impedances on inputs + and - of the differential channel.
    For channels with non-voltage measurement setting there is one set of indicators of connection
    resistance between + and - inputs of the channel. Indicators for disabled channels are inactive. 
    Each set of indicators includes bar gauge and digital value of impedance (resistance).
    <p>Bar gauges for channels with voltage measurement setting change their colors depending on
    impedance level. For recommended low electrode-skin impedance they are green, when impedance 
    goes higher to acceptable level, they become yellow. For unacceptably high impedances the 
    gauges are red.</p>
    <p>HINT: When signal state indicator for a given channel (or "Common voltage" indicator) 
    is red (signal is invalid), impedance indicators are not updated.</p>
  <li><p><b>Test</b> button - initiates test.<br>
    When physical measurement starts, the indicators become active. During the test most of the 
    configuration and menu options are locked. The test can be ended with <b>Stop</b> button, which 
    appears instead of Test button.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>HINT</b>: For multi-channel measurements of voltage signals (for example EEG), suitable settings of 
<b>Common reference</b> fields on individual channel tabs are necessary for correct electrode-skin 
impedance readings. For reference derivations (with common reference electrode) connection of 
- inputs to that electrode should be selected ("Reference 1" option if single reference electrode 
is used). For bipolar derivations the <b>Common reference</b> fields should be set to "No connection" 
(it is the default).</b>

<h3><a name="record">Record tab</a></h3>
<p>This tab is used to record signals in accordance with configuration
set on other tabs.
<p>State indicators shown on this tab can have up to four states:</p>
<ul>
  <li> disabled - if the indicator does not apply to current configuration and state
    or corresponding measurement channel is disabled;
  <li> green - correct state;
  <li> yellow - warning (e.g. weak battery or no signal in channel);
  <li> red - fault condition (e.g. battery flat or too high common voltage interferences).
</ul>
<p>Window contents:
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Link</b> - state of wireless link between measurement device and computer.<br>
    It is red, if the link is lost. This condition usually appears when the device goes 
    out of wireless communication range (typically 10 meters for Neurobit Optima). 
    If the device will be quickly brought closer 
    to a computer, link will be restored and recording will continue. (If lack of 
    communication is longer than about 60 seconds, recording will be ended.)</p>
  <li><p><b>Battery</b> - state of battery(ies) in measurement device.<br>
    If the indicator
    gets red (batteries flat), the device will turn off in a while. To avoid this 
    situation it is recommended to replace batteries, when the indicator gets yellow 
    (batteries become weak).</p>
  <li><p><b>Pause</b> - not used for Neurobit Optima.</p>
  <li><p><b>Common voltage</b> - indicator of common voltage interferences.<br>
    So called common voltage on inputs, which would 
    strongly interfere with measurement of small electrophysiological signals, is almost 
    totally removed by differential amplifiers. However, it is true only as far as the common 
    voltage is within dynamic range of the amplifier. To avoid uncontrolled conditions of pure 
    signal quality, Neurobit Optima supervises common voltage and indicates when it is too high
    (the indicator becomes red). In most cases the cause of that condition is lack of 
    electrical contact between Virtual Ground (VG) line and examined subject's body.</p>
  <li><p><b>Channel A</b> - state of signal in channel A.<br>
    At moments, when the signal goes 
    beyond measurement range, this indicator gets red. It is usually caused by bad 
    electrical contact of sensor or high amplitude interferences. This condition could also
    appear with correct connection and signal, if too small measurement range was set 
    for the channel.</p>
    <p>The yellow indicator means lack of signal. This condition is detected when measured 
    signal is many times lower than measurement range for long time (consult the equipment 
    manual for specific limits). Depending on type of signal it may be normal from time to 
    time. If the condition occurs frequently or all the time, it may be caused by short 
    circuit of electrodes of both channel inputs (maybe with excessive amount of conductive gel).
    This condition may also occur with correct connections, as a result of too large 
    measurement range set for the channel.</p>
  <li><p><b>Channel B</b> - state of signal in channel B, similarly as for Channel A.</p>
  <li><p><b>Record</b> button - initiates recording.<br> 
    If the output file already 
    exists, question about its rewriting appears. They may also be shown other messages, 
    for example if link between the device and computer cannot be established.</p>
    <p>When physical measurement starts, recording progress info appears above the 
    button and state indicators become active. During recording most of the configuration and 
    menu options are locked.
    <p>If "Time limit" was set on the Session tab,
    recording will be stopped automatically, when that period expires. Session can be
    also stopped manually at any time with <b>Stop</b> button appearing instead of Record 
    button.</p>
    <p>The only physical limit of recording time is free space on disk, where output file 
    is stored.<br>
    <i><u>Example</u>:
    For EDF output format each signal sample occupies 2 Bytes. If there are two enabled 
    channels sampled at 250 sps, it yields 2 * 2 * 250 = 1000 Bytes per second, i.e.
    3.6 MBytes per hour. For higher sample rate or more active channels data size will
    proportionally increase.</i></p>
